Signature Latte Recipe

Ingredients:

2 shots of espresso (or 1/2 cup of strongly brewed coffee)
1 cup of milk (whole milk, almond milk, oat milk, or any milk of your choice)
2 tablespoons of caramel sauce
1 tablespoon of vanilla syrup
Whipped cream (optional)
Caramel drizzle (optional)
Ground cinnamon or cocoa powder for garnish (optional)
Instructions:

Brew Espresso: Brew two shots of espresso using an espresso machine. If you don't have an espresso machine, you can use strongly brewed coffee as a substitute.
Heat Milk: In a small saucepan or using a milk frother, heat the milk until it's hot but not boiling. If using a milk frother, froth the milk until it becomes creamy and frothy.
Combine Ingredients: Pour the hot espresso shots into a mug. Add the caramel sauce and vanilla syrup to the espresso and stir until they are well combined.
Add Frothed Milk: Slowly pour the hot frothed milk into the mug, holding back the foam with a spoon to layer the milk evenly over the espresso mixture.
Top with Foam: Spoon the milk foam on top of the latte.
Optional Garnishes: If desired, top the latte with a dollop of whipped cream, a drizzle of caramel sauce, and a sprinkle of ground cinnamon or cocoa powder for an extra touch of flavor and presentation.
Serve: Your signature caramel vanilla latte is now ready to be enjoyed!
